## Planning
### First ideas
- Ballista
- Aircraft carrier launcher
- Air cannon
- Rc plane
We were first thinking about making a big ballista and launching a simple sensor projectile, but after watching a youtube video where someone made a massive ballista and could hardly launch a stick we lost hope.
After that we though about making a parachuted projectile we'd drop from a plane, but we weren't fans of that or any of our other ideas.
Finally, while talking to Vinnie and Matthias we had the idea to make a splitting plane. Each group would make one, and they'd fly up together before splitting apart. At first that took the shape of one plane dropping another, then two planes conjoined on their stomachs, but then we thought about attaching them together by the wings.

We looked into the idea and saw that planes like this existed in real life already, called a twin-fuselage aircraft.     â†“ XP-32 Mustang

From the start we knew there would be a few major challenges: 
The physical decoupling would have to be fast, reliable, and small. And we had some sort of hook and look design in mind.

The software control would also be tough. We realized early on that rc transmitters and recievers are at least $50 each, and if our groups were going to work together, it'd be cheaper to just get one. The plan as of writing is this: Vinnie and Matthias's team has the transmitter, and the reciever is on their plane. The planes will have a wired or wifi connection so that they are communicating with each other and flying ******, acting as one plane.


### Required Proof of Concepts
- Planes can fly on their own
- Motor has enough power
- Wing detatch
